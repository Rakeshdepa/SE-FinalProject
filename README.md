# SE-FinalProject

Video of the running application is attched, please watch, I created the video just to make it easy to understand.

Sir we stored the steps and their statistics in the .txt files

As we already emailed you about the mishap due to hard drive crash, we had very less time because much time wasted on fixing the laptop,
So, we used the same concepts, but we made sure that we create different projects.

So we will humbly requestyou to please consider our situation and ignore the small mistakes if you see them in project.

Thanks
